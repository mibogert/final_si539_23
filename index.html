                And what sticks are words. Words shape the intangible into the tangible. They are the handle by which we try to get ahold of what is going on around us and within us. We fit them around our experiences and in return make meaning. We push them together into sentences and paint reality.Words our our world.

                Contained within these pages are statements, pithy but profound, that stick to me when I read them. Some I've read many times. Some are fresh and new to me. But they all give me something to get ahold of words that have stuck to me. Some are old. Some new.

               I made categories for the collection but of course well said words trancend such conventions.
